## 🎯 CSS Classes Applied

```css
/* Sidebar & Navigation */
object-cover rounded

/* Hero Section & Auth Pages */
object-cover rounded-lg
```

**What these do:**
- `object-cover`: Maintains aspect ratio, crops if needed
- `rounded`: Small rounded corners (4px)
- `rounded-lg`: Larger rounded corners (8px)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Logo Optimization**
For best performance, consider:
- Compressing the JPEG (use tools like TinyJPG)
- Converting to WebP format for smaller file size
- Using appropriate dimensions (512x512px recommended)

### **Tip 2: Different Formats**
You can use different image formats:
- `.jpeg` / `.jpg` - Good for photos
- `.png` - Good for logos with transparency
- `.svg` - Best for scalable logos (no quality loss)
- `.webp` - Modern format, smaller file size

### **Tip 3: Favicon**
Don't forget to update your favicon too!
- Add `favicon.ico` to `public` folder
- Or use `app/icon.png` for Next.js automatic favicon
